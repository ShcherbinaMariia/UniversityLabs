# Complex systems modelling labs

## Lab 3: Analytic modelling of queueing network

## Lab 4: Simulation of queueing network

Goals of both Lab 3 and Lab 4 is obtaining system measures of queueing network.
Analytic modelling is faster and more general, but it can be done only under some assumptions on network.
Simulation helps to understand, how network works in specific case. Simulation is also very useful,
when there are finite length queues in network, because analytic modelling fails in this case.
